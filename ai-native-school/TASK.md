# TASK.md — Closed-claw Project Workflow (Ralph Loop Style)

## 1) Goal
Create a reliable, restart-safe, privacy-safe workflow so Sarah can keep progressing on issues with minimal supervision.

---

## 2) Operating Policy (Workflow First)

### A. GitHub Issue First (CRITICAL)
Before taking action on any item in the Tasks list section, **create a GitHub issue first** and then start work under that issue.
- **If you pick an existing task-list item to work on**:
  1. Create a GitHub issue for it (or confirm one already exists).
  2. Add the issue link/ID back into `TASK.md`.
  3. Only then begin implementation.
- **If a new problem/task arises during work**:
  1. Create a GitHub issue first.
  2. Then proceed with the work under that new issue.
  3. Update `TASK.md` to reflect the new item + issue link.
- **Sync Rule**: `TASK.md` must stay synced with GitHub. Every in-progress or planned task should have a corresponding GitHub issue. Close or mark completed tasks in `TASK.md` when the GitHub issue is closed.

### B. Scope Gate (MUST run first each cycle)
1. Detect chat context:
   - **Group chat** → public-safe mode only (no personal memory/details)
   - **Direct/private work session** → full project execution mode
2. Reject/redirect sensitive tasks if context is group and content is private.

### C. Ralph Loop Cycle (one issue per cycle)
1. **Pick next item** from backlog (`TASK.md` queue below)
2. **Create/update branch** for that single item
3. **Implement** smallest shippable change
4. **Run checks** (tests/lint/build as available)
5. **Commit + push** with clear message
6. **Open or update PR**
7. **Post concise status**
8. **Persist state** in files (`TASK.md`, optional `STATUS.md`) so restart can resume
9. Repeat next cycle
